# Security Intent Co-Pilot

**Author: Suneet Dungrani**

A revolutionary code review tool that validates code against developer-stated security intentions using advanced LLM technology.

## Overview

Security Intent Co-Pilot is a VS Code extension that bridges the gap between what developers intend their code to do from a security perspective and what it actually does. By leveraging Large Language Models through OpenRouter, it provides real-time security auditing based on developer-written intent comments.

## Features

- **Intent-Based Security Auditing**: Validates code against plain English security requirements
- **VS Code Integration**: Seamless integration into your development workflow
- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Uses state-of-the-art language models for deep security analysis
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get instant security insights as you code
- **Context-Aware**: Understands the full context of your security requirements

## Architecture

- **VS Code Extension**: TypeScript-based extension for seamless IDE integration
- **Backend Server**: Python Flask server for secure LLM communication
- **Docker Support**: Containerized testing environment for safe experimentation
